# Folder with memes

## Convention
- File names in `kebab-case` (e.g. `funny-meme.jpg`, `meme-with-pepe.jpg`)
- No capital letters in file names
- No empty file extension
- File name should be descriptive
- Only a-z letters and numbers in file names

## Disclamer
All the memes are protected with the freedom of speech. If something taunts you and you feel bad - it is your own problem.
